# Unraveling App TS

## Project Overview

This is a test project designed to evaluate the capabilities of AI as a reliable tool for assisting in frontend development. The application is a campaign element generator for RPGs, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, edit, and randomize lists of RPG items, with support for weighted random draws and list references.

## AI Collaboration

Nearly 100% of the codebase was created and edited by AI, guided by prompts written by a Software Engineer. The process included:

- Modularization and refactoring of React components
- Migration to Vite for modern frontend tooling
- Implementation of weighted random selection logic
- UI/UX improvements for mobile and desktop
- TypeScript type safety and data model enhancements
- Iterative debugging and feature development

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete RPG item lists
- Assign weights to items for probability-based draws
- Reference other lists within items
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Import/export lists via JSON

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to:

- Accelerate frontend development
- Maintain code quality and consistency
- Implement complex features with minimal manual intervention
- Collaborate effectively with human engineers

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the app locally with `npm run dev`
4. Access the app in your browser and start creating RPG lists

## Author

This project was developed as a collaboration between a Software Engineer and GitHub Copilot (AI).
